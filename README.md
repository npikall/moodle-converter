# Moodle Converter

This package aims to build a bridge between pythonic calculations and moodle 
formulas. It is designed to be used in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
The Idea is that you can use python to make some calculations and then use
this package to convert the formulas to a moodle compatible format to use in
quizzes.
